# Call, Apply, Bind Demo

Demo repository showing how `this` works in JavaScript using `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.

## 🧩 About

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, and the value of `this` depends on how a function is called.  
This repo contains examples and explanations for:

- `call()` – Calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments.
- `apply()` – Calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments as an array.
- `bind()` – Returns a new function with `this` bound to a specific object.
